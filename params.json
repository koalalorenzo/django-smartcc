{"name":"Django-smartcc","tagline":"A django Middleware that will help to set cache-control header on the views.","body":"# django-smartcc\r\nSet some cache-related headers automatically, defining not-authenticated\r\nrequests as public and authenticated requests as private. You can also customize these values for specific URLs. This middleware class will also setup these HTTP headers:\r\n\r\n* Vary\r\n* Cache-Control\r\n* Expires\r\n\r\nThis middleware works and is designed to integrate Django with CloudFlare Cache (or similar services). Used in production on MinbilDinbil.dk servers. \r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nAdd django-smartcc on your requirements.txt file or just launch:\r\n\r\n    pip install -U django-smartcc\r\n   \r\nThen add django-smartcc in the installed apps and in the middleware, so add these line in your settings.py file.\r\n\r\n    # settings.py\r\n    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES += [\r\n        'smart_cache_control.middleware.SmartCacheControlMiddleware'\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n**Note**: Remember that this middleware requires authentication, so it should be loaded after the *django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware*!\r\n    \r\n\r\n## Customization and Settings\r\nYou can customize a specific Cache-control value on each URL. For example\r\nif we want to avoid cache on */hello/* , but always have it on */api/search* for 5 minutes, we should write this in our settings file:\r\n\r\n    # settings.py\r\n    SCC_CUSTOM_URL_CACHE = (\r\n        (r'/hello/$', 'private', 0),\r\n        (r'/api/search$', 'public', 300),\r\n    )\r\n\r\nOther options are available to customize the behaviour of the middleware:\r\n\r\n**SCC_SET_VARY_HEADER**: Define if the middleware have to set the Vary header.\r\n                     Default value: *True*\r\n\r\n**SCC_SET_EXPIRE_HEADER**: Define if the middleware should set the Expires\r\n                       header. Default value: *True*\r\n\r\n**SCC_MAX_AGE_PUBLIC**: Define the default max-age value in seconds for public\r\n                    requests. Default value: *86400*\r\n\r\n**SCC_MAX_AGE_PRIVATE**: Define the default max-age value in seconds for\r\n                     private requests. Default value: *0*\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
